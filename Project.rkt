;; Project: TLS Interpreter in R5RS Scheme
;;
;; Description:
;; This project reimplements and formally analyzes the interpreter described
;; in Chapter 10 of *The Little Schemer*. The goal is to create a minimal
;; interpreter for a small subset of Scheme using only R5RS-compliant,
;; purely functional constructs.
;;
;; In addition to the implementation, this project focuses on formal reasoning,
;; including correctness proofs, syntax validation, and comparison with
;; DrRacket's built-in interpreter.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.1 Implement TLS in R5RS Scheme
;; - Translate the interpreter from Chapter 10 of TLS into pure R5RS Scheme.
;; - Use only functional constructsâ€”no mutation, macros, or side effects.
;; - Provide short specifications for each function.
;; - Include working example programs written in TLS syntax that demonstrate
;;   evaluation behavior.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.2 Write a Syntax Checker for TLS
;; - Define valid TLS programs inductively (as a grammar or AST).
;; - Implement a function `(valid-tls? expr)` to verify well-formedness.
;; - Detect errors such as:
;;     - Bad `cond` or `lambda` expressions
;;     - Incorrect number of arguments for built-in functions
;;     - Use of undefined variables (may use environment model)
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.3 Specify & Prove Environment Subsystem
;; - Formally define how environments and variable lookup should behave.
;; - Prove that `lookup-in-entry` and `lookup-in-table` behave correctly
;;   according to the specification.
;; - Replace current environment representation (e.g. name/value lists)
;;   with an alternative (e.g. list of (name . value) pairs).
;; - Prove the new representation satisfies the same formal spec.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.4 Prove Correct Use of Closures and Lexical Scope
;; - Define and explain closures and lexical scoping clearly.
;; - Show that your interpreter correctly forms closures by capturing
;;   the defining environment.
;; - Use structural induction and case analysis to prove that:
;;     - Closures behave consistently.
;;     - Lexical scope rules are preserved in all evaluation contexts.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.5 Prove TLS is Correct
;; - Define what "correct" means for your interpreter.
;;     (e.g., For every valid expression e, (value e) yields the intended result.)
;; - Formally prove that your interpreter implementation satisfies this
;;   definition of correctness.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.6 Explain Interaction with R5RS
;; - Analyze what TLS relies on from the underlying R5RS interpreter (e.g., DrRacket).
;; - Focus especially on:
;;     - Primitive operations (like +, car, cons)
;;     - Function application mechanics
;;     - How much evaluation is performed by TLS vs. by Scheme itself
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.7 Add Recursion to TLS using the Y-Combinator
;; - Extend TLS to support recursive functions using the Y-combinator
;;   (i.e., recursion without named functions).
;; - Prove that the Y-combinator implementation is correct.
;; - Demonstrate interesting recursive examples written in TLS syntax
;;   (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, length).

;; 1.1 Implement TLS in R5RS Scheme

;In chapter 10 of TLS we were introduced to an interpreter and our job is to turn it into code in R5RS.


;The first part we are introduced to in the chapter is the lookup code, which is basiclly a hashmap in other languages.
;The lookup takes in two parameters, the name you are looking for and the pair of lists, the first one which must be a set(Would need to implmement a checker?)
;The lists must also be equal length.


; This is used to build the lists, ensuring the specifications of a "hashmap" where each list has a key value pair
; and the length of both of the lists is equal



;COMMENTS FOR US: Put any ideas or what you plan to work on/improve or if stuck on something.
;; ============================================================================
; 4/14/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; So 1.1 of the project is telling us to make the functions in chapter 10 of the book ourselves, in R5RS scheme. The functions that they have
; are
; 1) lookup-in-entry (this takes two arguments, name and entry)
; 2) lookup-in-entry-helper (this is the helper function for #1. This is used when name is not found in the first list of an entry)
; 3) extend-table (this is like cons)
; 4) lookup-in-table (takes three arguments, name, table, and table-f)
; 5) expression-to-action (this produces the correct function for each possible S-expression. action == function)
; 6) atom-to-action
; 7) list-to-action
; 8-16) value, meaning, *const, *quote, *identifier, *lambda, *application, *evcon, *else
; 17-22) primitive?, non-primitive?, apply, apply-primitive, atom?, apply-closure
; Now how do we approach this? In chapter 10 of the book we have some functions written completely and we just need to convert that to R5RS,
; and some do not. Kenneth already began to create the basic helper functions and write the functions in Scheme (4/14/25). We started off by
; first creating the basic helper functions, the ones that are in the chapter and commonly used in TLS and then we went through the list one
; by one and made the functions. 


; 4/16/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; Today was just completing the build function in TLS, what this function does is that it returns an entry if it satisfies two conditions. The
; first condition being that the names list does not contain duplicates, aka is a set. And the second condition being that the values list and
; names list are of equal length. Both of the conditions have their own function, check-set and check-equal-len-list. Kenneth had already begun
; a basic outline of it, I just added onto it and finalized it. Alexis and me were working on the pre and post conditions as well.

; BASIC HELPER FUNCTIONS. These are basic functions such as atom?, add1, etc.
; Or they are functions that have been translated to R5RS Scheme.
;; ============================================================================

; This is the atom function which will check when an element is an atom and saves us from
; using redundant code. TLS also assumes this function is built in.
(define (atom? x)
  (and (not (pair? x)) (not (null? x))))


;This is a simple helper function that can be called that counts the number of elements in a list
(define (count-elements lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      0
      (+ 1 (count-elements (cdr lst)))))


;A function used to add by 1
(define (add1 n)
  (+ n 1))


;A function used to subtract by 1
(define (sub1 n)
  (- n 1))


;In TLS first refers to car
(define first car)


;In TLS second refers to cadr
(define second cadr)


;In TLS third refers to caddr
(define third caddr)


;In TLS extend-table refers to cons
(define extend-table cons)


; There are certain functions that we do not need to make as they are already in Scheme. For example,
; append, member?, and pair?.






;; ===========================================================================
; This is the lookup-in-entry function. Accompanied with it is the lookup-in-entry-helper.
;; ===========================================================================

;Design Idea:
;when looking up the entry there will be 3 possible cases, one where the name is found in entry, it will then return the associated value with the name.
;If it does not exist it will return the associated value once the entry-f is called.
;The third case will be if no name is given aka an empty char/string, then we call the entry-f function.
; ___________________
;[_______ayp|nyp_____]------>(first entry)= ayp----->(second entry) =nyp -------->(if ayp and nyp = name then we return entry-f)
;                                                                                   (needs helper)

;ayp: the first tables (ill go more in detail later i gotta push)
;nyp: the remaining tables


;pre/specs: takes three arguments, name (what we are looking for), entry (list of names and list of values),
;and entry-f, an error function if name not found.
(define (lookup-in-entry name entry entry-f)
  (lookup-in-entry-helper name
                        (first entry)
                        (second entry)
                        entry-f
                        ))
;post: returns the value associated with name if it exists in entry. If it does not exist, calls the entry-f function.


(define (lookup-in-entry-helper name names values entry-f)
   (cond
     ((null? names)(entry-f name))
     ((eq? (car names) name) (car values))
     (else
      (lookup-in-entry-helper
       name
       (cdr names)
       (cdr values)
       entry-f
       ))))

; Testing the function
; (define entry '((x y z) (1 2 3)))
; (lookup-in-entry 'x entry (lambda (name) 'not-found-in-entry)) ;returns 1
; (lookup-in-entry 'a entry (lambda (name) 'not-found-in-entry)) ;returns not-found-in-entry
; (lookup-in-entry 'entree '((appetizer entree beverage) (ar luka lebron)) (lambda (name) 'not-found)) ;returns luka





;; ===========================================================================
; This is the lookup-in-table function. 
;; ===========================================================================
;pre/specs: this takes three arguments, name (what we are looking for), table (it is a list of entries),
; and table-f (an error function if name is not found)
(define (lookup-in-table name table table-f)
   (cond
     ((null? table)(table-f name))
     (else
      (lookup-in-entry name
                       (car table)
                       (lambda (name)
                         (lookup-in-table name
                                          (cdr table)
                                           table-f))))))
;post: returns the value associated with name if it is found in table. if it does not exist, calls the table-f function.

;Testing the function
; (define table '(((entree dessert)
;                (spaghetti spumoni))
;               ((appetizer entree beverage)
;                (food tastes good))))
; (lookup-in-table 'entree table (lambda (name) 'not-found)) ;returns spaghetti
; (lookup-in-table 'dessert table (lambda (name) 'not-found)) ;returns spumoni
; (lookup-in-table 'appetizer table (lambda (name) 'not-found)) ;returns food
; (lookup-in-table 'snacks table (lambda (name) 'not-found)) ;returns not-found



            




;; ============================================================================
; TLS FUNCTIONS
; In TLS, it asks a crucial question, "How can we build an entry from a set of names and a list of values?"
; It then proceeds to tell us that we should try and build our examples with the function of
; (define new-entry build). And this is ultimately saying new-entry = build. So we need to make a build function.
;; ============================================================================





;; ===========================================================================
; This is the check-set function. It checks whether or not the list has duplicates.
; Sets cannot have duplicates.
;; ===========================================================================
;pre: list1 is a list
(define (check-set list1)
  (cond
    ((null? list1) #t)
    ((member (car list1) (cdr list1)) #f)
    (else
     (check-set (cdr list1)))))
;post: returns #t if list1 is a set and #f if it is not a set

;Testing the function
; (check-set '())           ;returns #t
; (check-set '(1 2 3 4))    ;returns #t
; (check-set '(1 2 2 3))    ;returns #f





;; ===========================================================================
; This is the check-equal-len-list function. It checks whether two lists are of equal length. 
;; ===========================================================================
;pre: list1 and list2 are lists
(define (check-equal-len-list list1 list2)
  (cond
    ((and (null? list1) (null? list2)) #t)
    ((or (null? list1) (null? list2)) #f)
    (else
     (check-equal-len-list (cdr list1) (cdr list2)))))
;post: returns #t or #f based on if the lists are of equal length or not


;Testing the function
; (check-equal-len-list '(x y z) '(10 20 30))  ;returns #t
; (check-equal-len-list '() '(1 2 3))          ;returns #f
; (check-equal-len-list '(x y z) '())          ;returns #f
; (check-equal-len-list '() '())               ;returns #t
; (check-equal-len-list '(a b c d) '(1 2 3))   ;returns #f





;; ===========================================================================
; This is the build function. It creates entry and validates that the names list has no dupes and
; the names list and values list are the same length. And then it returns the entry.
;; ===========================================================================

;pre: this takes two? three? arguments. names, values, and build-f (an error function). FIX THIS PRE CONDITION!
(define (build names values build-f)
  (cond
    ((not (check-set names)) (build-f "Names error. Names cannot have duplicates"))
    ((not (check-equal-len-list names values)) (build-f "Value error. Names and value must be equal length"))
    (else
     (list names values))))
;post: returns an entry if names has no duplicates and names and values are of equal length. otherwise, returns
;the appropriate error message. 


;Testing the function
; (build '(x y z) '(1 2 3) (lambda (message) message))     ;returns ((x y z) (1 2 3))
; (build '(x y z) '(1 2 3 4) (lambda (message) message))   ;returns value error.
; (build '(x x y z) '(1 2 3 4) (lambda (message) message)) ;returns name error
