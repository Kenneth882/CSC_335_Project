;; Project: TLS Interpreter in R5RS Scheme
;;
;; Description:
;; This project reimplements and formally analyzes the interpreter described
;; in Chapter 10 of *The Little Schemer*. The goal is to create a minimal
;; interpreter for a small subset of Scheme using only R5RS-compliant,
;; purely functional constructs.
;;
;; In addition to the implementation, this project focuses on formal reasoning,
;; including correctness proofs, syntax validation, and comparison with
;; DrRacket's built-in interpreter.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.1 Implement TLS in R5RS Scheme
;; - Translate the interpreter from Chapter 10 of TLS into pure R5RS Scheme.
;; - Use only functional constructsâ€”no mutation, macros, or side effects.
;; - Provide short specifications for each function.
;; - Include working example programs written in TLS syntax that demonstrate
;;   evaluation behavior.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.2 Write a Syntax Checker for TLS
;; - Define valid TLS programs inductively (as a grammar or AST).
;; - Implement a function `(valid-tls? expr)` to verify well-formedness.
;; - Detect errors such as:
;;     - Bad `cond` or `lambda` expressions
;;     - Incorrect number of arguments for built-in functions
;;     - Use of undefined variables (may use environment model)
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.3 Specify & Prove Environment Subsystem
;; - Formally define how environments and variable lookup should behave.
;; - Prove that `lookup-in-entry` and `lookup-in-table` behave correctly
;;   according to the specification.
;; - Replace current environment representation (e.g. name/value lists)
;;   with an alternative (e.g. list of (name . value) pairs).
;; - Prove the new representation satisfies the same formal spec.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.4 Prove Correct Use of Closures and Lexical Scope
;; - Define and explain closures and lexical scoping clearly.
;; - Show that your interpreter correctly forms closures by capturing
;;   the defining environment.
;; - Use structural induction and case analysis to prove that:
;;     - Closures behave consistently.
;;     - Lexical scope rules are preserved in all evaluation contexts.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.5 Prove TLS is Correct
;; - Define what "correct" means for your interpreter.
;;     (e.g., For every valid expression e, (value e) yields the intended result.)
;; - Formally prove that your interpreter implementation satisfies this
;;   definition of correctness.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.6 Explain Interaction with R5RS
;; - Analyze what TLS relies on from the underlying R5RS interpreter (e.g., DrRacket).
;; - Focus especially on:
;;     - Primitive operations (like +, car, cons)
;;     - Function application mechanics
;;     - How much evaluation is performed by TLS vs. by Scheme itself
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.7 Add Recursion to TLS using the Y-Combinator
;; - Extend TLS to support recursive functions using the Y-combinator
;;   (i.e., recursion without named functions).
;; - Prove that the Y-combinator implementation is correct.
;; - Demonstrate interesting recursive examples written in TLS syntax
;;   (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, length).

;; 1.1 Implement TLS in R5RS Scheme
;In chapter 10 of TLS we were introduced to an interpreter and our job is to turn it into code in R5RS.


;The first part we are introduced to in the chapter is the lookup code, which is basiclly a hashmap in other languages.
;The lookup takes in two parameters, the name you are looking for and the pair of lists, the first one which must be a set(Would need to implmement a checker?)
;The lists must also be equal length.


; This is used to build the lists, ensuring the specifications of a "hashmap" where each list has a key value pair
; and the length of both of the lists is equal



;COMMENTS FOR US: Put any ideas or what you plan to work on/improve or if stuck on something.
;; ============================================================================
; 4/14/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; So 1.1 of the project is telling us to make the functions in chapter 10 of the book ourselves, in R5RS scheme. The functions that they have
; are
; 1) lookup-in-entry (this takes two arguments, name and entry)
; 2) lookup-in-entry-helper (this is the helper function for #1. This is used when name is not found in the first list of an entry)
; 3) extend-table (this is like cons)
; 4) lookup-in-table (takes three arguments, name, table, and table-f)
; 5) expression-to-action (this produces the correct function for each possible S-expression. action == function)
; 6) atom-to-action
; 7) list-to-action
; 8-16) value, meaning, *const, *quote, *identifier, *lambda, *application, *evcon, *else
; 17-22) primitive?, non-primitive?, apply, apply-primitive, atom?, apply-closure


; 4/12-Kenneth(Comments Below)
; 1.1 is basicly a translation of TLS from TLS language into R5RS. I do notice that some functions from the book are repeated so i think the outline
; for the interpreter would be to get the simple functions and helpers out of the way first, that way we can keep refering to them and avoid redundent code.
; Initially i wll focus on just pure translation and then after everything is translated I will focus on connecting the important components

; 4/13/25 - Alexis (Comments Below)
; 1.1 of the project is based on TLS chapter 10. The implementations of the the function.
; One of the important things I have noticed are most functions are tail recursive (lookup-in-entry-helper, lookup,entry, etc.)
; This will be crucial for the proofs required from 1.5 so for now I have made a seperate file containing the proofs. 
; Before jumping into the proofs kenneth proposed we finish building the interperter so for now the proofs are not needed. 
; However, I labled each code with either T Recursion or Recursion so we will know in the future what proof will be needed
; for each function.


; 4/14/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)

; Now how do we approach this? In chapter 10 of the book we have some functions written completely and we just need to convert that to R5RS,
; and some do not. Kenneth already began to create the basic helper functions and write the functions in Scheme (4/14/25). We started off by
; first creating the basic helper functions, the ones that are in the chapter and commonly used in TLS and then we went through the list one
; by one and made the functions. 

; 4/14-Kenneth(Commments Below)
; I implememnted most of TLS straight from the book, some of the functions still need to be linked.Most of the test cases that i did work with the function
; on its own, however there are certain functions that connect that have some logical errors to them, so we will hopfully work on fixing that. Since TLS
; had some repeated functions that did diffrent things we still have to clean and fix that so that each function can past every test case.

; 4/14-Alexis(Comments Below)
; I reviewed the code Kenneth implemented and fixed some errors, and added some of the basic functions from the book TLS. 
; Kenneth explained the outline and how some of the functions are repeated and some of the logic in TLS is flawed.


; 4/16/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; Today was just completing the build function in TLS, what this function does is that it returns an entry if it satisfies two conditions. The
; first condition being that the names list does not contain duplicates, aka is a set. And the second condition being that the values list and
; names list are of equal length. Both of the conditions have their own function, check-set and check-equal-len-list. Kenneth had already begun
; a basic outline of it, I just added onto it and finalized it. Alexis and myself were working on the pre and post conditions as well.


; 4/17/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; Action functions.

; 4/19-Kenneth (Comments Below)
; Started on the Syntax checker for TLS.Since we have a lot of functions for TLS I decided to have two refrences, conditons and special conditions
; Conditions will be all the operations that can be easily checked such as some of the built in operations and some primitives. Since some
; operations will be more complex like lambada where we will probably have to reccur to check all the other operations inside it we can always refer
; to the condtions to show if the arguments inside them follow the correct format.


; 4/28/25 - Alexis (Comments Below)
; Since most of the interpreter is done Hamim volunteered to clean up the code. We came accross an issue when using the test expressions 
; Professor Troeger provided. We concluded it was due to apply, instead of using the apply we implemented through TLS, the function *application
; was using the built in apply. After discovering that issue, Hamim uncovered other issues with our initial-table and new entry.
; After looking into apply I started working on syntax-checker. Kenneth already started the outline. I added the pre and post condition.
; I also implemented functions such as member?, duplicates, check-cond(not fully done), and error messages.


; 4/29/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; Adding on to Alexis's comments. Yes, there were errors when certain test cases were run. These errors were annoying because it let to the same few
; functions. And those functions were linked to other functions. It was like a loop of errors in a sense. There were two main issues. My build function,
; the apply function, and the primitive and non-primitive functions. The root errors were 1) something was not a procedure, mcar errors, and mcdr errors.
; In order to solve this, I spent all of today reading TLS carefully. I noticed that we did have some missing functions, spelling errors, and we made some
; functions a little more complex than it should have been. We were missing quote, lambda, and our action functions were wrong as well. The value and meaning
; were also incorrect.


; 4/29-Kenneth(Comments Below)
; After My inital layout of the syntax checker i realized that some of the Design was not correct. We dont really need a special-checker since
; each of the functions like lambda,cond,if ect does its own unique thing so refering to that would be redundant.I'm still not finished with it but most of the
; basic operations are done.The specific TLS functions still need to be checked and also need to work on showing specific
; error messages instead of just outputting false.

; 4/29-Alexis (Comments Below)
; I realized how complicated Cond is when it comes to this since I will need the helper functions made for expression. 
; Although And and other functions were made, I only used syntax-checker we made.
; I also added specs to my previous function kenneth and I made. 
; And finished more basic functions.

; 4/30/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; Cleaning up code, making sure test cases all run. In order to make the output look nicer, I added two (newline) so it is easier to see the output and what
; section of code corresponds to what.


; 4/30/25 - Alexis (Comments Below)
; I implemented some finishing touches to 1.1 for we can present the code to the professor tomorrow. 
; I also cleaned up 1.2 file and added some specs we missed. 
; Fixed some errors as well.


; 5/8/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; So today was the first day that I was able to work on this for a while because I had exams + projects for other classes. However, I spent all day today working on
; two things. During our last interview (interview 1), professor told me to add more test cases and essentially make them more complex. That is what I did today, I
; was able to add test cases for all functions and made sure that they were fairly complex. The second thing I completed was Section 1.6 of the project. I worked with
; Alexis on this part.


; 5/9/25 - Hamim (Comments Below)
; Today's goal is to organize the interpreter so that the functions can all run (they all do, but it does not look organized). Also, today is fixing the specs, and adding
; more specs to each function. Alexis will also be joining in doing some of the specs and the pre/post conditions, and proofs. 












; Now how do we approach this? In chapter 10 of the book we have some functions written completely and we just need to convert that to R5RS,
; and some do not. Kenneth already began to create the basic helper functions and write the functions in Scheme (4/14/25). We started off by
; first creating the basic helper functions, the ones that are in the chapter and commonly used in TLS and then we went through the list one
; by one and made the functions. 


; BASIC HELPER FUNCTIONS. These are basic functions such as atom?, add1, etc.
; Or they are functions that have been translated to R5RS Scheme.
; Also included in this section are functions from TLS that we will use for our
; more complex functions, like action-to-action, action-to-list, etc.

;; ============================================================================

; This is the atom function which will check when an element is an atom and saves us from
; using redundant code. TLS also assumes this function is built in.
(define (atom? x)
  (and (not (pair? x)) (not (null? x))))


;This is a simple helper function that can be called that counts the number of elements in a list
(define (count-elements lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      0
      (+ 1 (count-elements (cdr lst)))))


;A function used to add by 1
(define (add1 n)
  (+ n 1))


;A function used to subtract by 1
(define (sub1 n)
  (- n 1))


;In TLS first refers to car
(define first car)


;In TLS second refers to cadr
(define second cadr)



;In TLS third refers to caddr
(define third caddr)



;In TLS, this is the else? function
(define (else? x)
  (and (atom? x) (eq? x 'else)))


;In TLS, this is returning the car of a cond
(define question-of first)


;In TLS, this returns the cadr of a cond
(define answer-of second)



;In TLS, this gives the cdr of a cond
(define cond-lines-of cdr)


;In TLS, this extracts the car of an application
(define function-of car)


;In TLS, this extracts the cdr of an application
(define arguments-of cdr)



;In TLS, this returns the data inside a quote
(define text-of second)


;In TLS, this gets the environment from a closure
(define table-of first)


;In TLS, this gets the parameters from a closure
(define formals-of second)


;In TLS, this returns the caddr
(define body-of third)


;This is a custom error message that we have made.
(define (error msg arg)
  (display "ERROR: ") (display msg) (display " ") (display arg) (newline))


;Not in TLS, but defined this because it is easier to do rather than type out constantly,
;This returns #t when an atom is a number, boolean, or primitive procedure. Or false otherwise.
; This is used to determine if an atom should be treated like a constant or a primitive procedure.

;pre: takes one argument which can be any Scheme value
;post: returns #t if the argument is a number, bool, one of the symbols in the list, or #f otherwise.
(define (const-atom? a)
  (or (number? a)
      (eq? a #t)
      (eq? a #f)
      (if
       (memq a '(cons car cdr null? eq? atom? zero? add1 sub1 number?))
       #t #f)))

;Testing the Function const-atom?
; (const-atom? 'add1)                                 ;returns #t
; (const-atom? 'sub1)                                 ;returns #t
; (const-atom? 'number?)                              ;returns #t
; (const-atom? 'false)                                ;returns #f
; (const-atom? '(1 2 3))                              ;returns #f
; (const-atom? '())                                   ;returns #f
; (const-atom? '(cons 1 2))                           ;returns #f
; (const-atom? (if (const-atom? 'add1) 'yes 'no))     ;returns #f
; (const-atom? (cdr '(#t #f 42)))                     ;returns #f
; (const-atom? (if (zero? 0) #t #f))                  ;returns #t
; (const-atom? (if (number? 5) 'number 'not-number))  ;returns #f




;===========================================================================================================
;This makes a new table. It takes formal parameters, values, and the current table. And then
;using (define new-entry build), it creates a new entry and then adds it to the front.

;pre: takes three arguments, formals (parameter names), vals(list of corresponding values), and table(list of entries).
;post: returns a new table with a new entry added to the front.

#|
=============================================================================================
Proof for extend-table:
;;Since this line of code has no recursion we will use proof by construction:

:Proof:
;(build formals vals) -> this create a proper entry,
;the cons prepends this entry to an existing table
; Therefore extend-table correctly implements environment extension by proof of construction.
=============================================================================================
|#

(define (extend-table formals vals table)
  (cons (build formals vals) table))
;===========================================================================================================




;===========================================================================================================
;Made because we assume that expression-to-action works. This evaluates the expression in a given
;environment.

;pre: e is an expression that will be evaluated. table is the currend environment
;post: returns the result of evaluating expression e in the table by using expression-to-action
(define (meaning e table)
  ((expression-to-action e) e table))
;===========================================================================================================




;===========================================================================================================
;This is a really important function, possibly one of the most important ones. This just evaluates everything.
;A lot of the test cases in the book and from Professor Troeger use this for test cases.

;pre: e is an expression that will be evaluated
;post: returns the evaluated value of e 

#| ;fix this proof
Proof:

the function directly calls (value e) = (meaning e '())
'() is the empty environment
meaning is correct (refer to 1.5)
Therefore: 
   âˆ€e. (value e) = âŸ¦eâŸ§_{âˆ…}
|#

(define (value e)
  (meaning e '()))
;===========================================================================================================




;So this was a main reason why our code was not working. In TLS, it gives us initial-table. However, if we carefully
;read it, it says that this should never be used really. So this is just like a fall back and gives an error. 
(define (initial-table name)
  (error "Unbound identifier" name))



;===========================================================================================================
; This is the build function. It creates entry and validates that the names list has no dupes and
; the names list and values list are the same length. And then it returns the entry.
;===========================================================================================================

;;pre: takes two arguments, s1 and s2 which can be any valid Scheme values
;;post: returns a list of two elements, s1 is first and then s2 is second
(define build
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    (cons s1 (cons s2 '()))))


;Testing the function
; (build '(x y z) '(1 2 3))             ;returns ((x y z) (1 2 3))
; (build '((a . 1) (b . 2)) '((x . 9))) ;(((a . 1) (b . 2)) ((x . 9)))
; (build '(a (b c)) (build '(x) '(1)))  ;((a (b c)) ((x) (1)))



;;pre: takes two arguments, a list of names as first. and second is a list of the values associated
;;post: returns a new environment entry
(define new-entry build)



;===========================================================================================================
; This is the lookup-in-entry function. Accompanied with it is the lookup-in-entry-helper.
;===========================================================================================================
#|
For this proof, we will use proof by induction
;pre and post are down below

;Proof
;Base Case: When names list is empty, call the function entry-f
;IH: Assume (lookup-in-entry name (cdr entry) entry-f) works correctly for smaller lists

;IS: If (car names) matches the target: it will return (car values) 
; if this is not the case then the recursion step will commence. Recurs on (cdr names) and (cdr values)
;By IH, this will either find the name or call entry-f
;Therefore, lookup-in-entry correctly searches through name-value pairs.

|#



;pre: takes three arguments. name (the symbol to look up), entry(a list where we essentially do the searching), entry-f(error message).
;post: if name is found in the list, it returns the corresponding value. if not found, it returns the error message.
(define (lookup-in-entry name entry entry-f)
  (let loop
    ((names (first entry))
     (values (second entry)))
    
    (cond
      ((null? names) (entry-f name))
      ((eq? (car names) name) (car values))
      (else
       (loop (cdr names) (cdr values))))))

; Testing the function
; (define entry '((x y z) (1 2 3)))
; (lookup-in-entry 'x entry (lambda (name) 'not-found-in-entry))                   ;returns 1
; (lookup-in-entry 'a entry (lambda (name) 'not-found-in-entry))                   ;returns not-found-in-entry
; (lookup-in-entry 'h2 '((h1 h2 h3) (ar luka lebron)) (lambda (name) 'not-found))  ;returns luka





;===========================================================================================================
; This is the lookup-in-table function. 
;===========================================================================================================
;pre: takes three arguments, name (what we are looking for), table (list of entries), and table-f (an error message if name is not found)
;;post: returns the value associated with name if it is found in table. if it does not exist, calls the table-f function.

#|
This is the proof for lookup-in-table
For this proof, we will use structural induction

;Proof:
Base Case:when tables is null, call the function table-f

IH: Assume (lookup-in-table name (cdr table) table-f) works correctly
IS: the function Tries (lookup-in-entry) on (car table)
If it is not found, we will recur on (cdr table)
By IH, this will search the remaining values correctly

Therefore, lookup-in-table works correctly.
|#

(define (lookup-in-table name table table-f)
   (cond
     ((null? table)(table-f name))
     (else
      (lookup-in-entry name (car table)
                       (lambda (name) (lookup-in-table name (cdr table) table-f))))))

;Testing the function
; (define table '(((entree dessert)
;                (spaghetti spumoni))
;               ((appetizer entree beverage)
;                (food tastes good))))

; (lookup-in-table 'entree table (lambda (name) 'not-found))    ;returns spaghetti
; (lookup-in-table 'dessert table (lambda (name) 'not-found))   ;returns spumoni
; (lookup-in-table 'appetizer table (lambda (name) 'not-found)) ;returns food
; (lookup-in-table 'snacks table (lambda (name) 'not-found))    ;returns not-found

; (define complex-table 
;   '(((alpha beta gamma)
;     (1 2 3))
;    ((delta epsilon zeta)
;     (4 5 (nested list)))
;    ((theta iota kappa)
;     ((deep nested) 8 9))))

; (lookup-in-table 'gamma complex-table (lambda (name) 'not-found))   ;returns 3
; (lookup-in-table 'zeta complex-table (lambda (name) 'not-found))    ;returns (nested list)
; (lookup-in-table 'theta complex-table (lambda (name) 'not-found))   ;returns (deep nested)
; (lookup-in-table 'lambda complex-table (lambda (name) 'not-found))  ;returns not-found






;===========================================================================================================
; TLS FUNCTIONS
; In TLS, it asks a crucial question, "How can we build an entry from a set of names and a list of values?"
; It then proceeds to tell us that we should try and build our examples with the function of
; (define new-entry build). And this is ultimately saying new-entry = build. So we need to make a build function.
;===========================================================================================================





;===========================================================================================================
; This is the check-set function. It checks whether or not the list has duplicates.
; Sets cannot have duplicates.
;===========================================================================================================

;pre: list1 is a list
;post: returns #t if list1 is a set and #f if it is not a set
(define (check-set list1)
  (cond
    ((null? list1) #t)
    ((member (car list1) (cdr list1)) #f)
    (else
     (check-set (cdr list1)))))

;Testing the function
; (check-set '())                                  ;returns #t
; (check-set '(1 2 3 4))                           ;returns #t
; (check-set '((lambda (x) x) (lambda (x) x)))     ;returns #f
; (check-set '(1 2 (lambda (x) x) 3))              ;returns #t  
; (check-set '(1 2 (lambda (x) x) (lambda (y) y))) ;returns #t





;===========================================================================================================
; This is the check-equal-len-list function. It checks whether two lists are of equal length. 
;===========================================================================================================

;pre: list1 and list2 are lists
;post: returns #t or #f based on if the lists are of equal length or not
(define (check-equal-len-list list1 list2)
  (cond
    ((and (null? list1) (null? list2)) #t)
    ((or (null? list1) (null? list2)) #f)
    (else
     (check-equal-len-list (cdr list1) (cdr list2)))))

;Testing the function
; (check-equal-len-list '() '(1 2 3))                                ;returns #f
; (check-equal-len-list '() '())                                     ;returns #t
; (check-equal-len-list '(1 2 (lambda (x) x)) '(a b (lambda (y) y))) ;returns #t
          





;===========================================================================================================
; Action Functions
; In chapter 10 of TLS, we once again meet the use of value. And value is the function that returns
; the natural value of expressions. After that, we then get introduced to the different action functions
; There are different types: *const, *quote, *identifier, *lambda, *cond, and *application. And to represent
; we use action functions. We have atom-to-action, expression-to-action, and list-to-action. 
;===========================================================================================================

;pre: takes one argument. fun (can be any Scheme value)

#| ; fix this proof
Proof for Evcon using Structural Induction
Base Case: idk!

IH:Assume (evcon (cdr lines) table) evaluates remaining clauses correctly

Inductive Step:
Evaluates (question-of (car lines)) using meaning
If true/else: returns (answer-of (car lines))
Else: recurs on (cdr lines)
By IH, this handles the remaining clauses properly
This shows evcon correctly implements the cond semantics.
|#

(define (evcon lines table)
  (cond
    ((else? (question-of (car lines))) (meaning (answer-of (car lines)) table))
    ((meaning (question-of (car lines)) table)
     (meaning (answer-of (car lines)) table))
    (else
     (evcon (cdr lines) table))))



;Takes a list of arguments and a table, and then returns a list composed of the meaning
;of each argument.
;pre: takes two parameters. arguments is what needs to be evaluated. table is the current environment
;post: returns a list of the evaluated arguments

#| ; this also need to be fixed
Proof for evlis using
structural induction
Base case: when args is null, it returns correct value ; this is wrong

IH: Assume (evlis (cdr args) table) evaluates remaining args correctly

IS: the function Evaluates (car args) using meaning function
it then cons onto recursive call with (cdr args)
By IH, (cdr args) evaluates correctly

Therefore, evlis properly evaluates argument lists

; This is the TLS apply primitive. It essentially handles all of the primitives in the chapter

Proof for tls-apply-primitive

Case Analysis Proof:
1. +: Applies R5RS addition 
2. cons: Creates pair 
3. car: Returns head of list (with error check) 
4. cdr: Returns tail 
5. null?: Checks emptiness 
6. eq?: Tests equality 
7. Default: Raises error 

Therefore all primitives are correctly implemented.

;In TLS, the function was originally called "apply", but Scheme R5RS already has its built in apply,
;so I made another one specifically called tls-apply.

;pre: takes two arguments. fun (value expected to be prim or non-prim. vals is a list of argument values
;post: if fun is primitive, it applies tls-apply-primitive and returns. if non-primitive, applies closure and returns.
;      else error message.

#| ;also needs to be fixed
Proof for TLS-Apply

Proof by cases:
1. primitive?: Delegates to tls-apply-primitive 
2. non-primitive?: Delegates to tls-apply-closure 
3. Else: Raises "not a function" error 

Therefore, tls-apply is implememnted correctly.

;pre: closure is a list with at least three elements: saved environment, formals list, and body expression;
;      vals is a list of argument values.
;post: extends saved environment with formals bound to vals, evaluates body in the new environment, and returns the result.

#|
Proof for Tls-apply-closure

Proof:
1. Unpacks (table formals body) from closure
2. Creates new env via (extend-table formals vals table)
3. Evaluates body in new env via meaning 

Hence, closures are applied correctly.
