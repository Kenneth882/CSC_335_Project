;; Project: TLS Interpreter in R5RS Scheme
;;
;; Description:
;; This project reimplements and formally analyzes the interpreter described
;; in Chapter 10 of *The Little Schemer*. The goal is to create a minimal
;; interpreter for a small subset of Scheme using only R5RS-compliant,
;; purely functional constructs.
;;
;; In addition to the implementation, this project focuses on formal reasoning,
;; including correctness proofs, syntax validation, and comparison with
;; DrRacket's built-in interpreter.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.1 Implement TLS in R5RS Scheme
;; - Translate the interpreter from Chapter 10 of TLS into pure R5RS Scheme.
;; - Use only functional constructsâ€”no mutation, macros, or side effects.
;; - Provide short specifications for each function.
;; - Include working example programs written in TLS syntax that demonstrate
;;   evaluation behavior.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.2 Write a Syntax Checker for TLS
;; - Define valid TLS programs inductively (as a grammar or AST).
;; - Implement a function `(valid-tls? expr)` to verify well-formedness.
;; - Detect errors such as:
;;     - Bad `cond` or `lambda` expressions
;;     - Incorrect number of arguments for built-in functions
;;     - Use of undefined variables (may use environment model)
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.3 Specify & Prove Environment Subsystem
;; - Formally define how environments and variable lookup should behave.
;; - Prove that `lookup-in-entry` and `lookup-in-table` behave correctly
;;   according to the specification.
;; - Replace current environment representation (e.g. name/value lists)
;;   with an alternative (e.g. list of (name . value) pairs).
;; - Prove the new representation satisfies the same formal spec.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.4 Prove Correct Use of Closures and Lexical Scope
;; - Define and explain closures and lexical scoping clearly.
;; - Show that your interpreter correctly forms closures by capturing
;;   the defining environment.
;; - Use structural induction and case analysis to prove that:
;;     - Closures behave consistently.
;;     - Lexical scope rules are preserved in all evaluation contexts.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.5 Prove TLS is Correct
;; - Define what "correct" means for your interpreter.
;;     (e.g., For every valid expression e, (value e) yields the intended result.)
;; - Formally prove that your interpreter implementation satisfies this
;;   definition of correctness.
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.6 Explain Interaction with R5RS
;; - Analyze what TLS relies on from the underlying R5RS interpreter (e.g., DrRacket).
;; - Focus especially on:
;;     - Primitive operations (like +, car, cons)
;;     - Function application mechanics
;;     - How much evaluation is performed by TLS vs. by Scheme itself
;;
;; ============================================================================
;; 1.7 Add Recursion to TLS using the Y-Combinator
;; - Extend TLS to support recursive functions using the Y-combinator
;;   (i.e., recursion without named functions).
;; - Prove that the Y-combinator implementation is correct.
;; - Demonstrate interesting recursive examples written in TLS syntax
;;   (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, length).

;; 1.1 Implement TLS in R5RS Scheme

;In chapter 10 of TLS we were introduced to an interpreter and our job is to turn it into code in R5RS.


;The first part we are introduced to in the chapter is the lookup code, which is basiclly a hashmap in other languages.
;The lookup takes in two parameters, the name you are looking for and the pair of lists, the first one which must be a set(Would need to implmement a checker?)
;The lists must also be equal length.


; This is used to build the lists, ensuring the specifications of a "hashmap" where each list has a key value pair
; and the lenght of both of the lists is equal

(define (new-entry build)
  (check-set (car build)) 
  ;Im thinking for this we use some tree properties with count to check the length
  (check-eq-len build))

;This function will tell us if a list is a set or if its not.
(define (check-set lst )
  (cond
    ((null? lst)
     '())
    ((member (car lst) (cdr lst))
     (set-f))
    (else (cons (car lst)
                (check-set (cdr lst))))))
;this is a helper function that displays if an error is found, in this case it is used to tell if the inputed list
; is a set or not
(define (set-f)
  (begin
    (display "Error: Not a set,duplicate elements found.")
    (newline)))

(define (check-eq-len nested-lst)
  (let ((list1 (car nested-lst))
        (list2 (cadr nested-lst)))
    (if (= (count list1) (count list2))
        #t
        (begin
          (display "Error: Lists are not of equal length.")
          (newline)
          #f))))
;This is a simple helper function that can be callled that counts the number of lists
(define (count lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      0
      (+ 1 (count (cdr lst)))))
  

;; ============================================================================

;Some small tests ( add more as more is added on and expand) Not Entirley correct as of rn but fix to match with book
